Hello there! 👋🏽 I'm a passionate beginner who recently dipped my shoes into the exciting world of programming, focused on Python.

# What You'll Find Here 🦾

In this repository, I'm documenting my journey of learning and experimenting with code.

🍀 Code Samples: I'll be sharing from simple "Hello, Beautiful World!" programs to more intermediate level programs and I'll also be curious to learn and share more advanced programs.

🌱 Mistakes and Lessons: I'm not afraid to admit that I make mistakes. Each mistake is a valuable lesson and I'll share what I learn along the way.
